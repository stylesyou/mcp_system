    Added the possibility to configure iFrame forwarding for the Runbooks
    Automation service. By default, the Rundeck service configuration does not
    enable you to get access through an external proxy address and exposed
    Rundeck port, which is 14440 by default. Now, you can easily forward the
    Runbooks dashboard through a proxy endpoint in case of using the Devops
    Portal through external proxy networks.
