    For stability and diversification of resources, Prometheus-based Stacklight
    and OSS services were moved to monitoring nodes. Now, on spawning new
    monitoring nodes, different Docker swarm is set up on them to deliver
    Stacklight and/or OSS services.

    To deploy Stacklight with OSS services on monitoring nodes, generate a new
    deployment model using the Model Designer UI.
