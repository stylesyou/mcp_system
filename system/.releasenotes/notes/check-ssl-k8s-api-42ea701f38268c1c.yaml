  Changed the SSL check type to ``check-ssl`` in HAProxy
  for the Kubernetes ``apiserver``

features:
  - Replaced the SSL check type from ``ssl-hello-chk`` to
    ``check-ssl`` in HAProxy for the Kubernetes
    ``apiserver``. This prevents the TLS errors in logs
    occurring during the check of SSLv3 that is not supported
    by the Kubernetes ``apiserver``.
