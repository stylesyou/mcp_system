   Added the ``td_agent_log_rotate_size`` parameter to Fluentd

features:
  - |
    Added the capability to specify the log rotation size for Fluentd
    ``td-agent`` using the ``td_agent_log_rotate_size`` parameter. This prevents a
    single log file from taking too much disk space. This parameter is set to
    10 MB by default.
