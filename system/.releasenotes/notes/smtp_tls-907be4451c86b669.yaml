  Additional option for push notification service to work with SMTP server

features:
  - Earlier the push notification service considered SMTP server working only under TLS.
    In case of custom SMPT servers which use non-TLS connection the push notification service is
    not working properly. This patch added the explicit definition of TLS using.
    To define this parameter you need to set 'pushkin_smtp_use_tls' variable on cluster level metadata.

    Example:
    .. code-block:: yaml
    parameters:
      _param:
        pushkin_smtp_use_tls: true
