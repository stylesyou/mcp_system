    Updated Elasticsearch and Kibana to v5. Elasticsearch and Kibana v5
    are now installed by default.

    To upgrade existing Elasticsearch and Kibana installations to v5,
    follow the procedures described in the MCP Operations Guide.

    .. TODO: add a link to the upgrade procedure.

    Kibana versions prior to 5.6.x are incompatible with Elasticsearch
    5.x. Therefore, once you upgrade Elasticsearch to v5, you must also
    upgrade Kibana to v5 as described in the MCP Operations Guide.
