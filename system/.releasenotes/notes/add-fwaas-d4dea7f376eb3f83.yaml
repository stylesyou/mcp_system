    Add system level metadata class required to enable FWaaS in Neutron.

    The Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS) plug-in applies firewalls to OpenStack
    objects such as projects, routers, router ports, as well as to VM ports
    and SFC ports in FWaaS V2.

    To enable FWaaS add the ``system.neutron.fwaas`` class to nodes with
    control, gateway and, if the Neutron DVR feature is enabled, compute roles.

    By default the FWaaS V1 is installed. To install FWaaS V2 redefine the
    ``fwaas_version`` parameter on the cluster level:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       fwaas_version: v2
