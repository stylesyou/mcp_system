    Added SSL support for the following cloud-monitoring services:

    * Rundeck CIS Collectors

      To provide ssl support for CIS, set up ``cert`` and ``ssl_cert_file``
      on a cluster level metadata:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         rundeck_cis_openstack:
           auth_url: ${_param:oss_openstack_auth_url}/auth/tokens
           username: ${_param:oss_openstack_username}
           password: ${_param:oss_openstack_password}
           cert: |
            -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
            MIIE0DCCA7igAwIBAgIBBzANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADCBgzELMAkGA1UEBhMCVVMx
            -----END CERTIFICATE-----
           ssl_cert_file: cert.pem

      If all parameters are defined properly, Rundeck enables the ssl support
      automatically.

    * Cleanup Service

      To provide ssl support for Cleanup Service, specify the cert path
      and set the ``ssl_verify`` variable to ``True`` on a cluster level
      metadata:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         janitor_monkey_openstack:
           username: ${_param:oss_openstack_username}
           password: ${_param:oss_openstack_password}
           auth_url: ${_param:oss_openstack_auth_url}
           ssl_verify: True
           cacert_path: ${_param:oss_openstack_cert_path}

    * Security Audit Service

      To provide ssl support for Security audit Service, provide cert path,
      set the ``ssl_verify`` variable to ``True``, and select the endpoint
      type for cloud connections on a cluster level metadata:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         security_monkey_openstack:
           username: ${_param:oss_openstack_username}
           password: ${_param:oss_openstack_password}
           auth_url: ${_param:oss_openstack_auth_url}
           ssl_verify: True
           endpoint_type: public
           cacert_path: ${_param:oss_openstack_cert_path}

      .. note:: By default, the ``cacert_path`` variable is defined as
                follows:

                .. code-block:: yaml

                   oss_openstack_cert_path: /srv/volumes/rundeck/storage/content/keys/cis/openstack/cert.pem
