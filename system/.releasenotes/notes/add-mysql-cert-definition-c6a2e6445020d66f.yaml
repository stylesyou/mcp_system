    Added a system class to generate certificates and keys for MySQL.

    **To generate files:**

    #. Include the class to the Reclass model of your deployment:

       .. code-block:: yaml

          classes:
             - system.salt.minion.cert.mysql.server

    #. Apply the :command:`salt.minion.cert` Salt state:

       .. code-block:: bash

          salt '*' state.sls salt.minion.cert
