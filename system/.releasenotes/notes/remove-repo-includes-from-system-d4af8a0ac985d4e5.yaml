summary: >
    Removed included classes for ``linux.system.repo`` from the system level
    Reclass model because they were breaking installation from local repos

features:
  - Added ``linux.system.repo`` definition for MAAS.

deprecations:
  - |
    Removed:

    - ``system.linux.system.repo.mcp.salt`` from ``salt/master/pkg.yml``
    - ``system.linux.system.repo.docker`` from ``docker/host.yml``
    - ``service.maas.region.vendor_repo`` from ``maas/region/single.yml``

    These repos should be added to appropriate cluster level classes.
    New cluster models from Cookiecutter have them already included.

fixes:
  - MCP deployments can now be installed from local repositories without
    problems.
