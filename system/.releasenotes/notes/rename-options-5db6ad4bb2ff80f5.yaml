    Improved the OpenStack cloud credentials defining process for the OSS
    services. The changes affect cluster and system levels of an MCP
    deployment and include the following:

    * ``cacert_path`` and ``cafile`` parameters for the Security Audit and
      Cleanup services has changed to:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         security_monkey_openstack:
           source_credentials: source/path/for/os/credentials/on/env
           service_credentials: path/to/os/credentials/in/service/container

         janitor_monkey_openstack:
           source_credentials: source/path/for/os/credentials/on/env
           service_credentials: path/to/os/credentials/in/service/container

      Now, you do not need to specify the certificate file but only the
      directory where it is located.
      The certificate file is named ``cert.pem`` for all services by default;
      and the ``source_credentials`` value equals to
      the value of the ``oss_openstack_credentials_path`` parameter.

    * ``oss_openstack_cert_path`` has changed as follows:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         oss_openstack_credentials_path: source/path/for/os/credentials/on/env
